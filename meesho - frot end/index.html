          <h3>FAQs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>How many roles are open?</h4></li>
            <p>There are multiple positions open at Meesho.</p>
            <li><h4>Can I apply for direct placement?</h4></li>
            <p>
              This challenge qualifies you for the internship role. Full time
              offer will be extended based on the performance during the
              internship period. For 2024 graduates, this is the sole option for
              engineering roles. If you have work experience, apply directly to
              relevant roles on our careers website.
            </p>
            <li>
              <h4>Will I get holidays for my college end-semester exams?</h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              Yes, we would suggest you discuss this with HR during your
              interview process so that the team can plan.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Can I work remotely?</h4></li>
            <p>
              No, Meesho operates in a hybrid model which means you need to be
              in the Bangalore office as per the team's requirements.
            </p>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Can I participate in a mock test before appearing for the test?
              </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              We recommend your participation in a mock test on the HackerRank
              platform challenge. This coding challenge is accessible on the
              HackerRank platform. Log in to the platform to commence mock
              tests. These exercises will enhance your familiarity with the
              platform and aid in effective time management. Additionally,
              please review the sample video for NextLevel, which will provide
              further insights into the mobile app.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Do I need to come to Bengaluru to give interviews?</h4></li>
            <p>No, this entire interview process is remote.</p>
            <li>
              <h4>
                Are the programming questions restricted to specific languages?
              </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              Programming language is not a barrier to this coding challenge
            </p>
            <li>
              <h4>
                What will happen in case there is an issue with my computer or
                internet connection?
              </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              If there is an issue with your computer or your Internet
              connection, you will not lose your previously submitted answers.
              They will be saved on servers. You can log in again and continue
              coding from where you stopped. However, the timer will continue
              running, which is why it is advised that you ensure that your
              computer/Internet connection is working properly before you begin
              the challenge.

              <h4>
                Is it possible to change my submission after I have submitted a
                question?,
              </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              HackerRank Test: Yes, you can edit and submit the solution to a
              question (that you can view and edit) any number of times before
              the challenge completion time window closes. This rule applies
              exclusively to HackerRank tests. Some tests have timed sections,
              and after the time limit is reached, you will not be able to
              revisit questions in that section. NextLevel Screening Test: In
              the NextLevel mobile app, once you answer a question, you cannot
              go back.
            </p>
            <li><h4>How does the time limit work?</h4></li>
            <p>
              Your program must read, process, and output the result for all
              input files within the specified time limit. The input file will
              be of the format that is specified in the problem. This means that
              if each input file contains multiple test cases, then your code
              must pass all the test cases within the specified time limit.
            </p>
            <li><h4>What happens if I indulge in plagiarism?</h4></li>
            <p>
              We take cheating/plagiarism very seriously and don't entertain
              such practices. All online tests are validated with plagiarism
              detection software and your entry will be rejected if flagged by
              the software algorithm.
            </p>

              <h4>
                Will I receive the results of the challenge? If yes, when?
              </h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              You will directly receive email after every stage of assessment.
              If selected, the team will reach out to you to schedule next
              interviews.
            </p>
            <li>
              <h4>Can we take up the challenges from mobile platforms?</h4>
            </li>
            <p>
              The first round-screening round is a mobile app based screening
              platform. You need to install on your mobile, login with your
              credentials and take the test from mobile. The hackerRank test
              platform is an online coding challenge that requires the
              participant to take it up from laptop/desktop.
